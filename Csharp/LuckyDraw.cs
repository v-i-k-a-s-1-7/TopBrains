// Description
// In a lucky draw, contestants with ticket numbers having a special property are chosen as Lucky Winners.

// Let S(n) be the sum of the digits of n. Example:
// S(484) = 4 + 8 + 4 = 16
// S(22) = 2 + 2 = 4
// A non-prime positive integer x is called a Lucky Number if:
// S(x × x) = S(x) × S(x)
// Example: 22 is a Lucky Number because:
// S(22) = 4
// S(484) = 16
// And 4 × 4 = 16 
// You must find how many Lucky Numbers lie between m and n (inclusive).
//  Sample Input 20 30
// Sample Output 4
